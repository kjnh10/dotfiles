This is a repository with my configuration files, those that in Linux/OS X normally are these files under the $HOME directory that are hidden and preceded by a dot, AKA dotfiles.

# Overview

# Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kjnh10/dotfiles.git
cd
./dotfiles/install.sh
```

# Note
'find' command used in this script is unix command.
So make sure shell's 'find' is not windows one.
